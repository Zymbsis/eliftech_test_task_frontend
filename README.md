Accomplished:

- Base level:

* Events board page: Implemented the events board page where users can view a
  paginated list of available events. The list of events is pre-populated in the
  database manually. Each event consists of: title, description, event date, and
  organizers.
* Event registration page: By clicking on 'Register', users are redirected to
  the event registration page, which contains a registration form with the
  following fields: full name, email, date of birth, and 'Where did you hear
  about this event?'. Once the form is submitted, the response is stored in the
  database.
* Event participants page: Implemented the event participants page where users
  can see a list of registered participants. This page is accessible by clicking
  on the 'View' button.

- Middle level:

* Everything from the base level.
* Events board page: Added the ability to sort events by title, event date, and
  organizer.
* Event registration page: Added form validation and a DatePicker for the date
  of birth input field.
* Event participants page: Added the ability to search participants by full name
  and email.
